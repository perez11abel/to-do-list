# To-do-list App

- Developed an interactive to-do list application leveraging Reactâ€™s useState hook, providing a user-friendly interface for task management and real-time state updates to ensure a responsive user experience.
- Implemented persistent state management for list items using local storage, ensuring data retention and continuity of user tasks across sessions, even after page reloads, until explicitly removed by the user.
